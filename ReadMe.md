# KNN

## I have much to learn about knitr.  I got "most" of the work done and I believe it's done correctly.  But, knitr is much finickier than RStudio.  I ran the code with no problem but knitting choked on knn() and confusionMatrix(), among others.  I was able to do the following:
  1. Print the Part 1 file to PDF from the main window. But, no graphics. 
  2. Knitted both Part 1 and Part 2 to PPT.  But, no graphics.  
  3. The graphics are there, but one would have to open the two .Rmd files to see them.  
 
 It's embarrasing to have done all this work and produce a product that no client would be impressed with.  I hope you'll have mercy on me.
